## To make things easier when running the rest of our commands, letâ€™s create a directory inside the image that we are building

WORKDIR /app
## Copying go.mod
COPY go.mod ./  go.sum ./

# Download and install go dependencies
RUN go mod download

## we need now to add our source code to our image
COPY . .
## We would like to compile our application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /docker-gs-ping

# Expose the port that your web forum listens on
EXPOSE 8080

## Now, all that is left to do is to tell Docker what command to execute when our image is used to start a container.
CMD ["/docker-gs-ping"]
